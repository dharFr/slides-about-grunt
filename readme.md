## Grunt Slides

Thoses slides (in French) were used during a quick talk about [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) I had at [@JSSophia](http://twitter.com/jssophia) #4 (2012 october 11)

All the cool things in there (DZSlides engine, template, shells, etc.) comes from [paulrouget/dzslides](https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides), which you should try because it's awesome.
